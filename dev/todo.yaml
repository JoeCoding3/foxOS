fix broken apps (were meant to be built into beaveros):
    apps:
        imgedit: fileutil
        filesys: fileutil
        camera: can't test on pc (no camera)
    other:
        fix using fileutil (different function names/parameters than apps expect):
            fileutil.file.download.handle
        fix fileutil/idb import:
            <script src="../../js/lib/idb.js"></script>
            <script src="../../js/lib/fileutil.js"></script>
        fix using idb to transfer data from filesys to editor (opening file)
make apps better:
    finish apps:
        camera
        imgedit
create builder (like beaveros?)
